# Wolf-Gang Engine

This is 2d engine that is meant to provide a simple platform for creating your own 2d games quick and easy. It takes a lot of inspiration from Yoyo's GameMaker.

It is still under heavy development so there isn't much to show here but here's a list of goals in mind:
- Versatile and easy to use editor.
- Project files that work nice with git.
- Flexible scripting using Lua.

### Building
___
Building _should_ be quite simple. It uses modern C++17 features so **you are required to use the latest GCC 7, Clang 7, and VS 2017 15.7 compilers in order to compile this project correctly.**.
3rdparty libraries are compiled as part of this project's source to ensure you have the correct version.

Dependencies:
- Latest compiler with C++17 compliance (GCC 7, Clang 7, and VS 2017 15.7)
- CMake

Clone the repository and cd to the new directory. The `--recursive` is important here because it will clone and initialize the submodules as well. I might consider just inlining those third party libraries if it becomes too much of an inconvenience so any feedback is welcome.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/clman94/Wolf-Gang-Engine.git
cd Wolf-Gang-Engine
```

Create a build directory to store the files generated by CMake.
```bash
mkdir ./build
cd build
```

Generate the project.
```bash
cmake ..
```

If you are using an IDE, open the project and make sure to set the "Startup project" to the WolfGangEngine Project and that should be it!

### License
___

This project is under the very permissive MIT license so you can modify and redistribute as appropriate for your project.
I do advise that you mention when you use code from this engine or use the engine to develop your game.
Maybe even send your own improvements as pull-requests. :)
